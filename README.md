Project: Priority Print Queing Simulation

This code simulates jobs being sent to the printer. The user sets up parameters including,the number of printers, the maximum number of pages one job can have, the number of jobs 
to complete and the number of pages the printer can print/time unit. Once the parameters 
are set, the code them creates print jobs every time unit of size between 1 - max # of pages. These jobs are placed into a tiered queue size based on the user input. 
The jobs are printed from high priority to low priority, in the order in which they were  received. Once the simulation is complete, the average wait time for a job to be printed 
is calculated. Also, based on research the total cost to print all the pages is calculate.This data is then outputted and based on the average wait time, we decide what you should do to maximize efficiency and save money.
